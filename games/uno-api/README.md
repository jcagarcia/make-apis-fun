## Rules

The aim of the game is to be the first player to play all its own cards.

The deck consists of 108 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four," and 25 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of "Skip," "Draw Two," and "Reverse." These last three types are known as "action cards."

To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:

* Play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
* Play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)
* Draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible
* Cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

Action or Wild cards have the following effects:
